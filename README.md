📊 Open University Learning Analytics (OULAD) – VLE Impact & Grade Prediction
This project analyzes the impact of the new Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) on student grades at The Open University (OU) using the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). The study focuses on two key questions:

Is the VLE improving students' grades?
Can we predict students' grades based on their interactions with the VLE and other factors?
📂 Dataset Overview
The OULAD dataset consists of seven interrelated tables:

courses.csv – Course details (modules, presentation periods).
assessments.csv – Assessment types, deadlines, and weights.
vle.csv – VLE activities available in each module.
studentInfo.csv – Student demographics, education history, and final results.
studentRegistration.csv – Student course registration details.
studentAssessment.csv – Assessment submissions and scores.
studentVle.csv – Student interactions with the VLE.
🔍 Analysis Approach
Impact of VLE on Grades: Evaluates whether increased engagement with the VLE leads to better student performance.
Predictive Modeling: Uses machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict student grades based on VLE interactions, demographics, and assessment performance.
Ethical Considerations: Ensures fairness by carefully analyzing demographic influences on predictions.
📌 Key Insights & Recommendations
If VLE engagement correlates positively with grades, promote VLE usage via targeted interventions.
Identify students at risk of failing early and offer personalized support.
Evaluate assessment types to determine if certain formats (e.g., online quizzes vs. assignments) contribute more to success.
🚀 Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization
